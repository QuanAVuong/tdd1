# Part 1: Numbers functions
- in your `numbers-tests.js` write tests for the following functions:
  - `add` (this is already provided to you as an example)
  - `filterEvens` takes an array (that could include any data type) and returns an array of only the even numbers
  - `secondSmallest` returns the second smallest number in an array
  - `uniqueNums` takes an array of numbers and returns only the unique numbers
- try running your tests. they should all fail at this point.
- complete the functions in the `js/numbers-funcs.js` file, one a time
- after you complete each function import it into your test file
- run your tests to make sure your solution is correct

# Part 2: Strings functions
- in your `strings-tests.js` write tests for the following functions:
  - `capitalize` (this is already provided to you as an example)
  - `capitalizeFirst` takes an array of strings and returns a new string with the first letter of each string capitalized
  - `OsToZeros` takes a string and returns a new string with all of the letter O's changed to the number 0
  - `countTheLetters` takes a string and returns an object with a count of the letters that appear in the string
- try running your tests. they should all fail at this point.
- complete the functions in the `js/strings-funcs.js` file, one a time
- after you complete each function import it into your test file
